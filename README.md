# Analysis-of-the-winning-time-over-the-years-for-100m-men-competition
First data analysis project
This is my first 'data analysis' project. Here i make an analysis of the time of winners for the 100m sprint competition for years 1896 through 2016.
I also scraped my own data, and applied what i learned from the machine learning andrew ng course (im at week 5 at the moment), developing a linear regression model to fit the training data.
